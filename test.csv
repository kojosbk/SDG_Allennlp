0,"Shell’s long-serving chief executive, Ben van Beurden, is preparing to step down next year after almost a decade in the role, according to Reuters.  The London-headquartered energy company has shortlisted four internal candidates to take his place after months of succession planning efforts that were accelerated once Sir Andrew Mackenzie became Shell’s chair in May 2021.  Van Beurden, who took over in 2014, would leave Shell in the middle of the most severe energy crisis of his tenure, which has subsequently pushed the oil and gas giant’s profits to record highs.  The energy boss, who was paid €7.4m (£6.1m) in 2021, warned earlier this week that gas shortages in Europe would probably last several years, raising the prospect of continued energy rationing.  Van Beurden could be replaced by the Canadian head of Shell’s integrated gas and renewables division, Wael Sawan, who is said to be the frontrunner in Shell’s search for a successor, according to Reuters. Other candidates include Shell’s chief financial officer, Sinead Gorman, its head of upstream, Zoe Yujnovich, and the boss of the company’s downstream refining operations, Huibert Vigeveno, the newswire reported.  Shell declined to comment on Van Beurden’s pending departure or his potential successors.  His departure would end a near-40-year career at Shell, which he joined in 1983. During his time as chief executive he oversaw one of the company’s biggest acquisitions in decades, buying BG Group for $53bn in 2016, and recently orchestrated the relocation of the company’s headquarters from the Netherlands to London.  While he has steered the company through two major oil market downturns, Van Beurden will leave just as sky-high oil prices are pushing Shell’s profits to record levels. Those profits are subject to a windfall tax in the UK, where consumers are facing soaring costs.  Earlier this week, Van Beurden warned that looming gas shortages caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could persist for several years, raising fears of energy rationing. “It may well be that we will have a number of winters where we have to somehow find solutions,” he told a press conference in Norway on Monday.  Van Beurden said solutions to the energy crisis would have to found through “efficiency savings, through rationing and a very, very quick buildout of alternatives”.

1,"A South African court has upheld a ban imposed on the energy giant Shell from using seismic waves to explore for oil and gas off the Indian Ocean coast.  The judgment delivered in Makhanda on Thursday marks a monumental victory for environmentalists concerned about the impact the exploration would have on whales and other marine life.  The 2014 decision granting the right for the “exploration of oil and gas in the Transkei and Algoa exploration areas is reviewed and set aside”, the high court ruled in the southern city.  Civil rights organisations and civilians celebrated outside the courthouse following the verdict, according to local media.  A Shell spokesperson said the company “respect[s] the court’s decision” and would review the judgment to “determine our next steps”. Shell did not say if it would appeal against the judgment or not. “We remain committed to South Africa and our role in the just energy transition,” he said.  Last December the same court had issued an interim order prohibiting the firm from going ahead with its plans.  Green Connection, one of the environmental and human rights organisations that filed the case against Shell, said that “civil society, traditional communities and small-scale [fishermen] have once again been vindicated by the courts”.  The petroleum firm was set to collect 3D seismic data over more than 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles) of ocean off South Africa’s Wild Coast - a 300km (185-mile) stretch of rich waters housing exquisite marine life and natural reserves.  Campaigners argued the research would have sent “extremely” loud shock waves every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day for five months, potentially harming marine species and disrupting their routines.  South Africa’s energy ministry had backed the scheme, and criticised those who opposed it as thwarting investment in the country’s development.",395,"the 2014 decision granting the right for the ""exploration of oil and gas in the Transkei and Algoa exploration areas is reviewed and set aside"" civil rights organisations and civilians celebrated outside the courthouse following the verdict. a Shell spokesperson said the company ""respect[s] the court’s decision"" and would review the judgment to ""determine our next steps"". last December the same court had issued an interim order prohibiting the firm from going ahead with its plans. campaigners argued the research would have sent """,Shell did not say if it would appeal against the judgment or not.,Makhanda
2,"Gas shortages across Europe are likely to last for several winters to come, the chief executive of Shell has said, raising the prospect of continued energy rationing as governments across the continent push to develop alternative supplies.  Cuts to the supply of Russian gas since the invasion of Ukraine have plunged European countries into a devastating energy crisis, driving up wholesale prices to leave consumers facing huge bills and the highest rates of inflation since the 1980s.  Speaking at a press conference in Norway on Monday, Ben van Beurden said the situation could persist for several years. “It may well be that we will have a number of winters where we have to somehow find solutions,” he said.  Van Beurden said solutions to the energy crisis would have to found through “efficiency savings, through rationing and a very, very quick buildout of alternatives”.  “That this is going to be somehow easy, or over, I think is a fantasy that we should put aside,” he added.  His comments come as Europe’s biggest economies brace for a tough winter of soaring inflation and the threat of recession, as record increases in gas and electricity bills pile pressure on households and businesses across the continent.  Russia, the major supplier of gas to most of the EU before the war in Ukraine, has throttled exports in response to western sanctions imposed since Vladimir Putin’s invasion six months ago. While not all EU countries are directly reliant on Russian supplies, competition for scarce resources has pushed wholesale European gas prices up by a factor of 12 compared with a year ago.  Britain sources little of its gas directly from Russia, although is exposed to soaring prices on the wholesale market. Liz Truss, who is likely to be the next British prime minister, has so far refused to spell out what help she would give to households as the price cap on energy bills jumps 80% to £3,549 a year from October.  Speaking on Monday, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said a package of emergency measures would be unveiled soon. Speaking in Slovenia as EU officials work on a plan, which could be announced as early as this week, Von der Leyen said “emergency interventions” would be introduced in addition to longer-term energy market reforms.  “Skyrocketing electricity prices are now exposing, for different reasons, the limitations of our current electricity market design,” she said.  The French prime minister, Elizabeth Borne, warned companies that energy could be rationed this winter, while Belgium’s energy minister said the next five to 10 years could be difficult.  Speaking alongside the Shell chief executive in Norway, the head of another energy company, TotalEnergies’s Patrick Pouyanné, said Europe’s governments and policymakers would have to plan for a future without Russian gas.  The comments were made at a ceremony to mark a carbon capture and storage deal between the two firms, the Financial Times reported. “If you think without it [Russian gas], we will manage. There is enough energy in this planet to do without it,” Pouyanné added.

European gas prices have soared in recent weeks, reaching almost €350 (£299) a megawatt hour last week as countries rushed to build up supplies before the winter. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Monday accused Russia of “economic terror” by trying to cut gas supplies to Europe.  “It is exerting pressure with price crisis, with poverty, to weaken Europe,” he said.  Maintenance work is expected to take place this week by Russian state-owned company Gazprom on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that links Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea, complicating efforts to fill up gas storage sites.  Wholesale gas prices fell back on Monday after Germany’s economy minister said he expected the country’s storage to be 85% full next month. However, prices still remain more than triple the level at the start of this year.  Soaring energy prices have helped oil and gas companies to record bumper profits, prompting demands for windfall taxes to help finance emergency support for struggling households and businesses. Shell made record profits of nearly £10bn between April and June and promised to give shareholders dividends worth £6.5bn.",1022,"cuts to the supply of Russian gas since the invasion of Ukraine have plunged European countries into a devastating energy crisis. the situation could persist for several years, says the chief executive of shell. van Beurden says solutions to the energy crisis would have to find through ""efficiency savings, through rationing and a very, very quick buildout of alternatives"". european commission president Ursula von der Leyen said a package of emergency measures would be unveiled soon. a spokesman for the s",Shell made record profits of nearly £10bn between April and June and promised to give shareholders dividends worth £6.5bn.,Europe
3,"Shell has agreed to pay half a million pounds for overcharging thousands of prepayment meter customers on default tariffs over the past three years.  The energy giant’s consumer arm, Shell Energy Retail, will refund and compensate 11,275 customers after it discovered that it had sent the wrong rates to users’ meters.  It meant that those customers were forced to pay more than allowed under the regulator’s price cap at various times since January 2019.  Prepayment meter users already pay for their energy at a higher rate and include some of the country’s poorest and most vulnerable households. Shell has agreed to automatically refund overcharged customers the £106,000 they are owed in total, pay £400,000 into Ofgem’s consumer redress fund, and make a further £30,970 in extra “goodwill payments” to affected customers.  The energy provider will pay a total of £536,970. Customers are expected to receive refunds worth £9.40 each, on average.  A Shell Energy spokesperson said: “We’re sincerely sorry that errors updating our prepayment meter rates resulted in some customers being overcharged for a period of time. As soon as we identified the issue we began taking steps to put it right, and self-reported it to Ofgem.” The company said it would be writing to customers to notify them about the payments.  Ofgem said the compensation package “would have been considerably higher” had Shell not self-reported the issue and taken steps to address the problem. The regulator also considered the additional financial hardship that the issue may have placed on prepayment customers, especially when energy prices have risen to historic highs.  The regulator’s director of retail, Neil Lawrence, said: “Ofgem expects suppliers to adhere to the terms of contracts they have with customers, particularly ensuring they pay no more than the level of the price cap.  “Households across Britain are already struggling with rising energy bills and living costs,” he added. “Overcharging by suppliers can cause additional and unnecessary stress and worry at what is already a very challenging time for consumers across the UK.”  Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the second time the company has breached the price cap since it was introduced, having been forced in 2019 to compensate 12,000 customers whom it overcharged when the company was still trading under the First Utility brand. Shell bought the company in 2018.  “Ofgem is always prepared to work with suppliers who have failed to comply with their obligations, but who have self-reported and are determined to put things right, as Shell has done here,” Lawrence added. “The contributions Shell has made to the redress fund will help to support vulnerable consumers with their energy bills.”",680,"energy giant's consumer arm, shell energy retail, will refund and compensate 11,275 customers after it discovered it had sent the wrong rates to users' meters. customers were forced to pay more than allowed under the regulator's price cap at various times since January 2019. the company will automatically refund overcharged customers the £106,000 they are owed in total. it will also pay £400,000 into ofgem's consumer redress fund. customers expected to receive refunds worth £9.40 each, on average. ofge",had Shell not self-reported the issue and taken steps to address the problem,Britain
4,"The chair of the Church of England Pensions Board, which has not divested its £3.5bn fund from fossil fuels, is a shareholder in Shell, the Guardian can reveal.  Clive Mather had a 38-year career at the oil company during which he oversaw a multibillion-dollar tar sands project in Canada.  The Church of England (C of E) has rejected pressure to sell off its fossil fuel holdings. Campaigners said these were unethical investments that were fuelling the climate crisis and urged Mather to resign.  In Britain, the Baptist church and United Reformed church have divested from fossil fuels. Around the world, 17 Anglican dioceses are among more than 500 churches and faith-based organisations that have divested.  The leader of the C of E, the archbishop Justin Welby, said at a recent global conference of Anglican bishops: “It’s the call of the church to stand alongside our brothers and sisters around the Anglican communion, who are already affected by climate change, and to safeguard the environment upon which all of us depend.”  Protesters at the conference calling for fossil fuel divestment included the Rev Vanessa Elston, from Southwark diocese and a member of the protest group Christian Climate Action. She told the Guardian the revelation that Mather owned shares in Shell was “shocking”.  “The C of E needs to divest because the fossil fuel companies have been lying and greenwashing for 40 years,” she said. “They have acted wickedly. If they were serious about the climate crisis, they would be putting 50% of their profits into renewables, but they are not doing anywhere near that.”  One of the Lambeth Calls, declarations published after the conference, demanded the “halting of new gas and oil exploration”. Shell’s short-term expansion plans amount to about 4bn barrels of oil. Elston said: “If you really are going to fulfil that call, that means divesting.”  Operation Noah, a Christian climate group, urged Mather to resign. “In light of his conflict of interest, Operation Noah calls for Mr Mather to consider his position,” said the Rev Dr Darrell Hannah, at All Saints church in Ascot and chair of trustees for the group. “And we again call on the C of E to divest from all fossil fuels immediately, not next year.”  The C of E £10bn church commissioners fund has also not divested from fossil fuels.  Bishop Shourabh Pholia, from the diocese of Barisal in Bangladesh and who attended the conference, said: “Up to 18 million people may have to migrate [from Bangladesh] because of sea-level rise,” he said. “Therefore, I want to stand with the protesters to do justice to the earth and save the whole of creation.”  Mather has always recused himself from any discussion of, or direct contact with, Shell. A C of E spokesperson said: “Any suggestion that Mr Mather’s shares in Shell in any way influences the pensions board’s investment policy around fossil fuels would be false. The pensions board and church commissioners have a clear five-year strategy on fossil fuels, agreed by the General Synod in 2018.”  He said the results included a net zero oil and gas standard being piloted by oil and gas majors, investor pressure leading to companies adopting emissions targets and divestment from companies refusing to engage. The C of E would divest from fossil fuel companies not aligned with the Paris climate agreement by July 2023, he said.

At the C of E’s general synod in July 2021, Mather described his former employer Shell as a “beacon across the sector”. Another member of the pensions board, Richard Hubbard, worked for BP for 28 years, while Welby was the group treasurer for Enterprise Oil from 1984 to 87.  Divestment campaigners argue that selling off fossil fuel shares is a powerful way to reduce companies’ social licence to operate and restrict their access to capital. More than 1,500 institutions managing $40tn have divested from fossil fuels, including almost 200 pension funds.  Shell said in 2020: “An erosion of our business reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand, our ability to secure new resources or access capital markets, and on our licence to operate.”  Opponents of divestment argue engaging with companies as shareholders to drive change is a better way to tackle the climate crisis. The C of E pension fund holds about £10m of fossil fuel shares.  The C of E pension board says it required fossil fuel companies it invests in to have “alignment of capital expenditure and production plans with a net zero target”. However, in February, the most comprehensive study to date concluded that accusations of greenwashing were well-founded against major oil companies that claim to be in transition to clean energy, including Shell.  “It’s clear that investor engagement has failed,” said Hannah. “Given the overwhelming harm that fossil fuel emissions are causing to people and planet, it is no longer ethical to profit from fossil fuels, something the C of E continues to do, and something that, sadly, Mr Mather is apparently still doing as well.”  One of the most high-profile supporters of fossil fuel divestment campaigns was the late Desmond Tutu, an Anglican archbishop. “People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change,” he told the Guardian in 2014.  The vast majority of fossil fuel reserves owned by countries and companies must remain in the ground if the climate crisis is to be ended, a 2021 analysis found.  Experts have warned that if governments fulfil their pledges to slash carbon emissions, much of these reserves could become worthless. A recent study found people in rich countries could lose more than $1tn in total.",1405,"the church of england has rejected pressure to sell off its fossil fuel holdings. campaigners said these were unethical investments fuelling the climate crisis. 17 anglican dioceses are among more than 500 churches and faith-based organisations that have divested. the revelation that Clive Mather owned shares in shell is ""shocking"". he oversaw a multibillion-dollar tar sands project in canada. the revelation comes after the church of england",it is no longer ethical to profit from fossil fuels,Canada
