0,"Shell’s long-serving chief executive, Ben van Beurden, is preparing to step down next year after almost a decade in the role, according to Reuters.  The London-headquartered energy company has shortlisted four internal candidates to take his place after months of succession planning efforts that were accelerated once Sir Andrew Mackenzie became Shell’s chair in May 2021.  Van Beurden, who took over in 2014, would leave Shell in the middle of the most severe energy crisis of his tenure, which has subsequently pushed the oil and gas giant’s profits to record highs.  The energy boss, who was paid €7.4m (£6.1m) in 2021, warned earlier this week that gas shortages in Europe would probably last several years, raising the prospect of continued energy rationing.  Van Beurden could be replaced by the Canadian head of Shell’s integrated gas and renewables division, Wael Sawan, who is said to be the frontrunner in Shell’s search for a successor, according to Reuters. Other candidates include Shell’s chief financial officer, Sinead Gorman, its head of upstream, Zoe Yujnovich, and the boss of the company’s downstream refining operations, Huibert Vigeveno, the newswire reported.  Shell declined to comment on Van Beurden’s pending departure or his potential successors.  His departure would end a near-40-year career at Shell, which he joined in 1983. During his time as chief executive he oversaw one of the company’s biggest acquisitions in decades, buying BG Group for $53bn in 2016, and recently orchestrated the relocation of the company’s headquarters from the Netherlands to London.  While he has steered the company through two major oil market downturns, Van Beurden will leave just as sky-high oil prices are pushing Shell’s profits to record levels. Those profits are subject to a windfall tax in the UK, where consumers are facing soaring costs.  Earlier this week, Van Beurden warned that looming gas shortages caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could persist for several years, raising fears of energy rationing. “It may well be that we will have a number of winters where we have to somehow find solutions,” he told a press conference in Norway on Monday.  Van Beurden said solutions to the energy crisis would have to found through “efficiency savings, through rationing and a very, very quick buildout of alternatives”.

1,"A South African court has upheld a ban imposed on the energy giant Shell from using seismic waves to explore for oil and gas off the Indian Ocean coast.  The judgment delivered in Makhanda on Thursday marks a monumental victory for environmentalists concerned about the impact the exploration would have on whales and other marine life.  The 2014 decision granting the right for the “exploration of oil and gas in the Transkei and Algoa exploration areas is reviewed and set aside”, the high court ruled in the southern city.  Civil rights organisations and civilians celebrated outside the courthouse following the verdict, according to local media.  A Shell spokesperson said the company “respect[s] the court’s decision” and would review the judgment to “determine our next steps”. Shell did not say if it would appeal against the judgment or not. “We remain committed to South Africa and our role in the just energy transition,” he said.  Last December the same court had issued an interim order prohibiting the firm from going ahead with its plans.  Green Connection, one of the environmental and human rights organisations that filed the case against Shell, said that “civil society, traditional communities and small-scale [fishermen] have once again been vindicated by the courts”.  The petroleum firm was set to collect 3D seismic data over more than 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles) of ocean off South Africa’s Wild Coast - a 300km (185-mile) stretch of rich waters housing exquisite marine life and natural reserves.  Campaigners argued the research would have sent “extremely” loud shock waves every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day for five months, potentially harming marine species and disrupting their routines.  South Africa’s energy ministry had backed the scheme, and criticised those who opposed it as thwarting investment in the country’s development.","Transkei,Algoa,Makhanda",Shell
2,"Gas shortages across Europe are likely to last for several winters to come, the chief executive of Shell has said, raising the prospect of continued energy rationing as governments across the continent push to develop alternative supplies.  Cuts to the supply of Russian gas since the invasion of Ukraine have plunged European countries into a devastating energy crisis, driving up wholesale prices to leave consumers facing huge bills and the highest rates of inflation since the 1980s.  Speaking at a press conference in Norway on Monday, Ben van Beurden said the situation could persist for several years. “It may well be that we will have a number of winters where we have to somehow find solutions,” he said.  Van Beurden said solutions to the energy crisis would have to found through “efficiency savings, through rationing and a very, very quick buildout of alternatives”.  “That this is going to be somehow easy, or over, I think is a fantasy that we should put aside,” he added.  His comments come as Europe’s biggest economies brace for a tough winter of soaring inflation and the threat of recession, as record increases in gas and electricity bills pile pressure on households and businesses across the continent.  Russia, the major supplier of gas to most of the EU before the war in Ukraine, has throttled exports in response to western sanctions imposed since Vladimir Putin’s invasion six months ago. While not all EU countries are directly reliant on Russian supplies, competition for scarce resources has pushed wholesale European gas prices up by a factor of 12 compared with a year ago.  Britain sources little of its gas directly from Russia, although is exposed to soaring prices on the wholesale market. Liz Truss, who is likely to be the next British prime minister, has so far refused to spell out what help she would give to households as the price cap on energy bills jumps 80% to £3,549 a year from October.  Speaking on Monday, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said a package of emergency measures would be unveiled soon. Speaking in Slovenia as EU officials work on a plan, which could be announced as early as this week, Von der Leyen said “emergency interventions” would be introduced in addition to longer-term energy market reforms.  “Skyrocketing electricity prices are now exposing, for different reasons, the limitations of our current electricity market design,” she said.  The French prime minister, Elizabeth Borne, warned companies that energy could be rationed this winter, while Belgium’s energy minister said the next five to 10 years could be difficult.  Speaking alongside the Shell chief executive in Norway, the head of another energy company, TotalEnergies’s Patrick Pouyanné, said Europe’s governments and policymakers would have to plan for a future without Russian gas.  The comments were made at a ceremony to mark a carbon capture and storage deal between the two firms, the Financial Times reported. “If you think without it [Russian gas], we will manage. There is enough energy in this planet to do without it,” Pouyanné added.

European gas prices have soared in recent weeks, reaching almost €350 (£299) a megawatt hour last week as countries rushed to build up supplies before the winter. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Monday accused Russia of “economic terror” by trying to cut gas supplies to Europe.  “It is exerting pressure with price crisis, with poverty, to weaken Europe,” he said.  Maintenance work is expected to take place this week by Russian state-owned company Gazprom on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that links Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea, complicating efforts to fill up gas storage sites.  Wholesale gas prices fell back on Monday after Germany’s economy minister said he expected the country’s storage to be 85% full next month. However, prices still remain more than triple the level at the start of this year.  Soaring energy prices have helped oil and gas companies to record bumper profits, prompting demands for windfall taxes to help finance emergency support for struggling households and businesses. Shell made record profits of nearly £10bn between April and June and promised to give shareholders dividends worth £6.5bn.","Norway,Belgium,Europe,Russia,Ukraine,Britain,Germany,Slovenia","EU,Shell,TotalEnergies,Gazprom,Newsletters"
