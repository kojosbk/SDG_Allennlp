The London-headquartered energy company has shortlisted four internal candidates to take his place after months of succession planning efforts that were accelerated once Sir Andrew Mackenzie became Shell’s chair in May 2021.  Van Beurden, who took over in 2014, would leave Shell in the middle of the most severe energy crisis of his tenure, which has subsequently pushed the oil and gas giant’s profits to record highs.  The energy boss, who was paid €7.4m (£6.1m) in 2021, warned earlier this week that gas shortages in Europe would probably last several years, raising the prospect of continued energy rationing.  Van Beurden could be replaced by the Canadian head of Shell’s integrated gas and renewables division, Wael Sawan, who is said to be the frontrunner in Shell’s search for a successor, according to Reuters. Other candidates include Shell’s chief financial officer, Sinead Gorman, its head of upstream, Zoe Yujnovich, and the boss of the company’s downstream refining operations, Huibert Vigeveno, the newswire reported.  Shell declined to comment on Van Beurden’s pending departure or his potential successors.  His departure would end a near-40-year career at Shell, which he joined in 1983. During his time as chief executive he oversaw one of the company’s biggest acquisitions in decades, buying BG Group for $53bn in 2016, and recently orchestrated the relocation of the company’s headquarters from the Netherlands to London.  While he has steered the company through two major oil market downturns, Van Beurden will leave just as sky-high oil prices are pushing Shell’s profits to record levels. Those profits are subject to a windfall tax in the UK, where consumers are facing soaring costs.  Earlier this week, Van Beurden warned that looming gas shortages caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could persist for several years, raising fears of energy rationing. “It may well be that we will have a number of winters where we have to somehow find solutions,” he told a press conference in Norway on Monday.  Van Beurden said solutions to the energy crisis would have to found through “efficiency savings, through rationing and a very, very quick buildout of alternatives”.

1,South African court bans offshore oil and gas exploration by Shell,,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/01/south-african-court-bans-offshore-oil-and-gas-exploration-by-shell,"A South African court has upheld a ban imposed on the energy giant Shell from using seismic waves to explore for oil and gas off the Indian Ocean coast.  The judgment delivered in Makhanda on Thursday marks a monumental victory for environmentalists concerned about the impact the exploration would have on whales and other marine life.  The 2014 decision granting the right for the “exploration of oil and gas in the Transkei and Algoa exploration areas is reviewed and set aside”, the high court ruled in the southern city.  Civil rights organisations and civilians celebrated outside the courthouse following the verdict, according to local media.  A Shell spokesperson said the company “respect[s] the court’s decision” and would review the judgment to “determine our next steps”. Shell did not say if it would appeal against the judgment or not. “We remain committed to South Africa and our role in the just energy transition,” he said.  Last December the same court had issued an interim order prohibiting the firm from going ahead with its plans.  Green Connection, one of the environmental and human rights organisations that filed the case against Shell, said that “civil society, traditional communities and small-scale [fishermen] have once again been vindicated by the courts”.  The petroleum firm was set to collect 3D seismic data over more than 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles) of ocean off South Africa’s Wild Coast - a 300km (185-mile) stretch of rich waters housing exquisite marine life and natural reserves.  Campaigners argued the research would have sent “extremely” loud shock waves every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day for five months, potentially harming marine species and disrupting their routines.  South Africa’s energy ministry had backed the scheme, and criticised those who opposed it as thwarting investment in the country’s development.","waves,gas,sq,judgment,shell,court,bans,south,marine,energy,exploration,offshore,set,oil,african",2022-09-01
2,"European gas shortages likely to last several winters, says Shell chief",Gwyn Topham,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/29/european-gas-shortages-likely-to-last-several-winters-shell-chief-rationing-europe-russia,"Gas shortages across Europe are likely to last for several winters to come, the chief executive of Shell has said, raising the prospect of continued energy rationing as governments across the continent push to develop alternative supplies.  Cuts to the supply of Russian gas since the invasion of Ukraine have plunged European countries into a devastating energy crisis, driving up wholesale prices to leave consumers facing huge bills and the highest rates of inflation since the 1980s.  Speaking at a press conference in Norway on Monday, Ben van Beurden said the situation could persist for several years. “It may well be that we will have a number of winters where we have to somehow find solutions,” he said.  Van Beurden said solutions to the energy crisis would have to found through “efficiency savings, through rationing and a very, very quick buildout of alternatives”.  “That this is going to be somehow easy, or over, I think is a fantasy that we should put aside,” he added.  His comments come as Europe’s biggest economies brace for a tough winter of soaring inflation and the threat of recession, as record increases in gas and electricity bills pile pressure on households and businesses across the continent.  Russia, the major supplier of gas to most of the EU before the war in Ukraine, has throttled exports in response to western sanctions imposed since Vladimir Putin’s invasion six months ago. While not all EU countries are directly reliant on Russian supplies, competition for scarce resources has pushed wholesale European gas prices up by a factor of 12 compared with a year ago.  Britain sources little of its gas directly from Russia, although is exposed to soaring prices on the wholesale market. Liz Truss, who is likely to be the next British prime minister, has so far refused to spell out what help she would give to households as the price cap on energy bills jumps 80% to £3,549 a year from October.  Speaking on Monday, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said a package of emergency measures would be unveiled soon. Speaking in Slovenia as EU officials work on a plan, which could be announced as early as this week, Von der Leyen said “emergency interventions” would be introduced in addition to longer-term energy market reforms.  “Skyrocketing electricity prices are now exposing, for different reasons, the limitations of our current electricity market design,” she said.  The French prime minister, Elizabeth Borne, warned companies that energy could be rationed this winter, while Belgium’s energy minister said the next five to 10 years could be difficult.  Speaking alongside the Shell chief executive in Norway, the head of another energy company, TotalEnergies’s Patrick Pouyanné, said Europe’s governments and policymakers would have to plan for a future without Russian gas.  The comments were made at a ceremony to mark a carbon capture and storage deal between the two firms, the Financial Times reported. “If you think without it [Russian gas], we will manage. There is enough energy in this planet to do without it,” Pouyanné added.

European gas prices have soared in recent weeks, reaching almost €350 (£299) a megawatt hour last week as countries rushed to build up supplies before the winter. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Monday accused Russia of “economic terror” by trying to cut gas supplies to Europe.  “It is exerting pressure with price crisis, with poverty, to weaken Europe,” he said.  Maintenance work is expected to take place this week by Russian state-owned company Gazprom on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that links Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea, complicating efforts to fill up gas storage sites.  Wholesale gas prices fell back on Monday after Germany’s economy minister said he expected the country’s storage to be 85% full next month. However, prices still remain more than triple the level at the start of this year.  Soaring energy prices have helped oil and gas companies to record bumper profits, prompting demands for windfall taxes to help finance emergency support for struggling households and businesses. Shell made record profits of nearly £10bn between April and June and promised to give shareholders dividends worth £6.5bn.","wholesale,winters,gas,supplies,winter,chief,storage,shell,prices,minister,russian,european,energy,week,likely,shortages",2022-08-29
3,"Shell to pay £536,000 for overcharging prepayment customers",Kalyeena Makortoff,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/25/shell-pay-536000-overcharging-prepayment-meter-customers,"Shell has agreed to pay half a million pounds for overcharging thousands of prepayment meter customers on default tariffs over the past three years.  The energy giant’s consumer arm, Shell Energy Retail, will refund and compensate 11,275 customers after it discovered that it had sent the wrong rates to users’ meters.  It meant that those customers were forced to pay more than allowed under the regulator’s price cap at various times since January 2019.  Prepayment meter users already pay for their energy at a higher rate and include some of the country’s poorest and most vulnerable households. Shell has agreed to automatically refund overcharged customers the £106,000 they are owed in total, pay £400,000 into Ofgem’s consumer redress fund, and make a further £30,970 in extra “goodwill payments” to affected customers.  The energy provider will pay a total of £536,970. Customers are expected to receive refunds worth £9.40 each, on average.  A Shell Energy spokesperson said: “We’re sincerely sorry that errors updating our prepayment meter rates resulted in some customers being overcharged for a period of time. As soon as we identified the issue we began taking steps to put it right, and self-reported it to Ofgem.” The company said it would be writing to customers to notify them about the payments.  Ofgem said the compensation package “would have been considerably higher” had Shell not self-reported the issue and taken steps to address the problem. The regulator also considered the additional financial hardship that the issue may have placed on prepayment customers, especially when energy prices have risen to historic highs.  The regulator’s director of retail, Neil Lawrence, said: “Ofgem expects suppliers to adhere to the terms of contracts they have with customers, particularly ensuring they pay no more than the level of the price cap.  “Households across Britain are already struggling with rising energy bills and living costs,” he added. “Overcharging by suppliers can cause additional and unnecessary stress and worry at what is already a very challenging time for consumers across the UK.”  Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the second time the company has breached the price cap since it was introduced, having been forced in 2019 to compensate 12,000 customers whom it overcharged when the company was still trading under the First Utility brand. Shell bought the company in 2018.  “Ofgem is always prepared to work with suppliers who have failed to comply with their obligations, but who have self-reported and are determined to put things right, as Shell has done here,” Lawrence added. “The contributions Shell has made to the redress fund will help to support vulnerable consumers with their energy bills.”","overcharging,privacy,536000,customers,shell,prepayment,energy,suppliers,pay,company,price,selfreported",2022-08-25
4,"Church of England pension boss’s shares in Shell ‘shocking’, say campaigners",Damian Carrington,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/church-of-england-pension-bosss-shares-shell-clive-mather,"The chair of the Church of England Pensions Board, which has not divested its £3.5bn fund from fossil fuels, is a shareholder in Shell, the Guardian can reveal.  Clive Mather had a 38-year career at the oil company during which he oversaw a multibillion-dollar tar sands project in Canada.  The Church of England (C of E) has rejected pressure to sell off its fossil fuel holdings. Campaigners said these were unethical investments that were fuelling the climate crisis and urged Mather to resign.  In Britain, the Baptist church and United Reformed church have divested from fossil fuels. Around the world, 17 Anglican dioceses are among more than 500 churches and faith-based organisations that have divested.  The leader of the C of E, the archbishop Justin Welby, said at a recent global conference of Anglican bishops: “It’s the call of the church to stand alongside our brothers and sisters around the Anglican communion, who are already affected by climate change, and to safeguard the environment upon which all of us depend.”  Protesters at the conference calling for fossil fuel divestment included the Rev Vanessa Elston, from Southwark diocese and a member of the protest group Christian Climate Action. She told the Guardian the revelation that Mather owned shares in Shell was “shocking”.  “The C of E needs to divest because the fossil fuel companies have been lying and greenwashing for 40 years,” she said. “They have acted wickedly. If they were serious about the climate crisis, they would be putting 50% of their profits into renewables, but they are not doing anywhere near that.”  One of the Lambeth Calls, declarations published after the conference, demanded the “halting of new gas and oil exploration”. Shell’s short-term expansion plans amount to about 4bn barrels of oil. Elston said: “If you really are going to fulfil that call, that means divesting.”  Operation Noah, a Christian climate group, urged Mather to resign. “In light of his conflict of interest, Operation Noah calls for Mr Mather to consider his position,” said the Rev Dr Darrell Hannah, at All Saints church in Ascot and chair of trustees for the group. “And we again call on the C of E to divest from all fossil fuels immediately, not next year.”  The C of E £10bn church commissioners fund has also not divested from fossil fuels.  Bishop Shourabh Pholia, from the diocese of Barisal in Bangladesh and who attended the conference, said: “Up to 18 million people may have to migrate [from Bangladesh] because of sea-level rise,” he said. “Therefore, I want to stand with the protesters to do justice to the earth and save the whole of creation.”  Mather has always recused himself from any discussion of, or direct contact with, Shell. A C of E spokesperson said: “Any suggestion that Mr Mather’s shares in Shell in any way influences the pensions board’s investment policy around fossil fuels would be false. The pensions board and church commissioners have a clear five-year strategy on fossil fuels, agreed by the General Synod in 2018.”  He said the results included a net zero oil and gas standard being piloted by oil and gas majors, investor pressure leading to companies adopting emissions targets and divestment from companies refusing to engage. The C of E would divest from fossil fuel companies not aligned with the Paris climate agreement by July 2023, he said.

At the C of E’s general synod in July 2021, Mather described his former employer Shell as a “beacon across the sector”. Another member of the pensions board, Richard Hubbard, worked for BP for 28 years, while Welby was the group treasurer for Enterprise Oil from 1984 to 87.  Divestment campaigners argue that selling off fossil fuel shares is a powerful way to reduce companies’ social licence to operate and restrict their access to capital. More than 1,500 institutions managing $40tn have divested from fossil fuels, including almost 200 pension funds.  Shell said in 2020: “An erosion of our business reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand, our ability to secure new resources or access capital markets, and on our licence to operate.”  Opponents of divestment argue engaging with companies as shareholders to drive change is a better way to tackle the climate crisis. The C of E pension fund holds about £10m of fossil fuel shares.  The C of E pension board says it required fossil fuel companies it invests in to have “alignment of capital expenditure and production plans with a net zero target”. However, in February, the most comprehensive study to date concluded that accusations of greenwashing were well-founded against major oil companies that claim to be in transition to clean energy, including Shell.  “It’s clear that investor engagement has failed,” said Hannah. “Given the overwhelming harm that fossil fuel emissions are causing to people and planet, it is no longer ethical to profit from fossil fuels, something the C of E continues to do, and something that, sadly, Mr Mather is apparently still doing as well.”  One of the most high-profile supporters of fossil fuel divestment campaigns was the late Desmond Tutu, an Anglican archbishop. “People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change,” he told the Guardian in 2014.  The vast majority of fossil fuel reserves owned by countries and companies must remain in the ground if the climate crisis is to be ended, a 2021 analysis found.  Experts have warned that if governments fulfil their pledges to slash carbon emissions, much of these reserves could become worthless. A recent study found people in rich countries could lose more than $1tn in total.","companies,pension,shocking,say,campaigners,climate,c,shell,fuel,fuels,england,fossil,shares,bosss,mather,oil,church",2022-08-17
5,Shell to give staff 8% bonus after record profits,Julia Kollewe,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/shell-staff-bonus-record-profits-oil-gas-prices,"Shell is handing nearly all its 82,000 staff a bonus equivalent to 8% of their salary after the oil company reported record profits amid soaring energy prices.  The British multinational is making the one-off payment to the vast majority of its employees around the world, only excluding those on its executive committee, executive vice-presidents and contractors.  The oil firm said: “In recognition of the contribution our people have made to Shell’s strong operational performance against a recent challenging backdrop, our executive committee has decided to make a special recognition award of 8% of salary to all eligible staff across the world.  “The award enables those employees to share in our current operational and financial success – it is not a response to inflation or cost of living challenges.”  Last Thursday, the FTSE 100 company revealed it had made record profits of nearly $11.5bn (£9.5bn) for the second quarter in a row on the back of soaring oil and gas prices, and strong refining profit margins, and promised to give shareholders payouts worth £6.5bn.  It is a significant turnaround for a company that laid off thousands of workers, suspended bonuses and capped salaries during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, described the profits as “an insult to the millions of working people struggling to get by because of soaring energy bills”.  Overall, the world’s five biggest oil companies shared bumper profits of nearly $100bn in the first six months of this year.  On Tuesday, Shell’s UK rival BP was accused of “unfettered profiteering” after its underlying profits tripled to $8.5bn (£6.9bn) between April and June, thanks to high oil prices. It was its biggest quarterly profit in 14 years and BP said it would hand out nearly £4bn to shareholders as a result.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  This prompted calls for a tougher windfall tax on energy companies, which are enjoying a profits bonanza while consumers struggle with a cost of living crisis as energy and food prices surge. Households’ average annual energy bills are expected to exceed £3,600 this winter.  As Russia’s invasion grinds on, the research firm Cornwall Insight predicted the energy price cap on annual bills in Great Britain was on track to rise to £3,615 a year from January.  The cap, which is set quarterly by the energy industry regulator, Ofgem, was at £1,400 a year in October. Cornwall predicts the cap will remain above £3,400 for the entirety of 2023, piling further pressure on household finances.  Energy prices have soared amid fears over supplies caused in part by the war in Ukraine. The oil cartel Opec and its allies agreed a small increase in oil output by just 100,000 barrels a day on Wednesday, dashing hopes of a larger increase, which is likely to keep oil prices elevated.  The BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, whose total pay reached £4.5m last year, in February described BP as a “cash machine”, even before the war raised prices further.","soaring,staff,profits,executive,shell,prices,bp,energy,record,nearly,company,cap,oil,bonus",2022-08-03
6,Oil company profits boom as Americans reel from high fuel prices,Dominic Rushe,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/29/oil-gas-company-profits-fuel-prices-shell-exxon-chevron,"The US’s biggest oil companies pumped out record profits over the last few months as Americans struggled to pay for gasoline, food and other basic necessities.  On Friday, ExxonMobil reported an unprecedented $17.85bn (£14.77bn) profit for the second quarter, nearly four times as much as the same period a year ago, and Chevron made a record $11.62bn (£9.61bn). The sky-high profits were announced one day after the UK’s Shell shattered its own profit record.  Soaring energy prices have rattled consumers and become a political flashpoint. “We’re going to make sure everybody knows Exxon’s profits,” Joe Biden said in June. “Exxon made more money than God this year.”  The record profits came after similarly outsized gains in the first quarter when the largest oil companies made close to $100bn in profits.  High energy prices are one of the leading factors driving inflation to a four-decade high in the US. Gas prices have fallen slightly in recent weeks but are now averaging $4.25 a gallon across the US, more than $1 a gallon higher than a year ago.  Consumers are facing high fuel prices not just at the pump. Soaring energy prices are being baked into delivery costs, which is driving up the cost of everything from apples to toilet paper.  One reason gasoline prices have been so high is that fewer refineries are operating in the US than before the pandemic, so there is a limit to how much gasoline can be produced.  Biden has called for the companies to increase production and refining capacities in an attempt to bring down prices. On Friday Exxon said it was expanding refinery and production in Texas and New Mexico.  Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, increased its oil and gas production as crude prices hovered above $100 a barrel. Revenue at Exxon soared to $115.68bn, up from $67.74bn during the same quarter last year.  Natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices are also elevated due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ensuing sanctions against Russia, a large supplier of natural gas. Many European nations have been scrambling for alternatives to Russian natural gas, and have been competing for boatloads of LNG, driving up prices for natural gas globally and in the US.  In addition to oil company executives, shareholders also reaped the benefits of high energy prices during the quarter. Since the start of 2022, Exxon and Chevron shares have risen close to 46% and 26%, respectively.  Exxon’s CEO, Darren Woods, attributed the company’s success to its investments in oil and gas fields in Guyana and the Permian Basin, as well as its investments in liquefied natural gas, which has been in high demand globally.  “We’re also helping meet increased demand by expanding our refining capacity by about 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023 – representing the industry’s largest single capacity addition in the US since 2012,” Woods said in a prepared statement.  Chevron’s chief executive officer, Mike Wirth, sought to tamp down criticism that the company was profiteering at the expense of consumers.  “We more than doubled investment compared to last year to grow both traditional and new energy business lines,” Wirth said in the statement. “Chevron is increasing energy supplies to help meet the challenges facing global markets,” he said.  Exxon and Chevron’s bumper profits were announced a day after Shell posted record earnings of $11.4bn (nearly £10bn) for the three-month period from April to June.  Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of Britain’s Trades Union Congress, called the “eye-watering profits” “an insult to the millions of working people struggling to get by because of soaring energy bills.  “Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history. It’s time working people got their fair share of the wealth they create, starting with real action to bring bills down,” said O’Grady.

7,"With such eye-watering profits, Shell should invest more in low-carbon transition",Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jul/28/with-such-eye-watering-profits-shell-should-invest-more-in-low-carbon-transition,"BP’s Bernard Looney put it more succinctly last year when he described the company as “a cash machine at these types of prices”, but Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, was coming from the same place as he reflected on almost £10bn of profits in a single quarter. “Of course these are very significant [profit] margins, but these margins are not our doing. They are the doing of how global markets play out,” he said.  He’s right about market conditions obviously. A barrel of Brent fetched well over $100 during the quarter, gas prices have gone to the moon; refining capacity is severely tight; and the entire industry underinvested during the first year of the pandemic, creating near-perfect conditions for a spike in prices when Russia invaded Ukraine.  But the maddening bit of Van Beurden’s breezy account is what he says in the next breath – the claim to be “working very hard to bring on new supplies” and to be investing furiously in “the energy system of the future”, meaning a lower carbon one. Shell, it is obvious, could afford to allocate far greater sums to investment, including renewables, but is choosing not to do so.  Current plans involve numbers that look large at first sight: $23bn to $27bn of capital expenditure this year, with a one-third skew towards renewables; and, for a UK audience, an average of £3bn-a-year to be invested here until the end of the decade. The point, though, is that those spending plans flow from a model that was drawn up 18 months ago before a windfall fell into Shell’s lap.  The “financial framework” imagines that every last dollar, beyond what’s ear-marked for investment, debt-servicing and regular dividends, goes to shareholders via share buy-backs. The size of these buy-backs is now extraordinary: $6bn for the current quarter, after $8.5bn in the first half. Add regular dividends, and Shell, a company worth £150bn, could return 15% of its market capitalisation to investors in 2022.  Shareholders and pension funds must have prizes, of course, but allocating no extra capital towards low-carbon projects is indefensible given the resources suddenly at Shell’s disposal. The company calls its approach “disciplined”, but it is behaving as if nothing has changed, or that it has run out of ideas. The story here is not simply one of markets “playing out”. It is also about the pace at which the company funds transition. Shell could transition faster – much faster.  Reading the room  By contrast, it is impossible to get angry about Centrica’s modest dividend for shareholders, even if it attracts more political flak. The owner of British Gas hasn’t paid a dividend for two years and a half-year distribution of £59m, or a penny a share, does not come at the expense of useful investment.  The most important looming investment decision relates to the re-opening of the Rough offshore storage facility in the North Sea, which, everybody now agrees, should never have been closed. For the sake of energy security (gas and, in future, hydrogen), it is vital the company and the UK government find a contract-for-difference arrangement.  The contribution of British Gas, the retail supply business, to half-year operating profits of £1.3bn wasn’t much – £98m, equivalent to a profit margin of 2%. Instead, the money was mostly made in North Sea production and via higher prices for nuclear-generated electricity (Centrica owns a 20% stake in the UK’s fleet). Since those assets are captured by the windfall tax, outrage about the dividends should fade.  Distribution to shareholders are allowed, after all – indeed are vital to keep investment flowing. It’s the level, and the other aspects of a company’s performance, that matter. Shell looks grasping. Centrica, now that it’s stopped grumbling about the windfall tax and is talking about decarbonising projects, looks better attuned to the mood outside.  Never-boring Barclays  Many chief executives in the recent past have tried to make Barclays boring. CS Venkatakrishnan, who was supposed to mark a break from the era of regulatory thrills and spills under Jes Staley (and others before him), isn’t there yet.  The lowlight of the half-year numbers was a £581m net charge for a cock-up that saw the bank sell more structured notes – securities giving exposure to baskets of stocks, interest rates and so on – than it was authorised to flog.  The “litigation and conduct” fun continued via a $200m whack from US regulators’ clamp-down on traders sending work messages via WhatsApp, and a penalty for past larks with timeshare loans. The actual operational performance was fine, but you can see why the shares continue to be lowly rated. You never know what’s coming next with Barclays.","gas,halfyear,profits,shell,eyewatering,prices,investment,transition,quarter,shareholders,invest,company,shells,windfall,lowcarbon",2022-07-28
8,‘Insult to millions’: Shell and Centrica profits cause outrage as energy bills soar,Rob Davies,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/an-insult-soaring-profits-at-shell-and-centrica-cause-outrage,"Soaring profits at two of the UK’s biggest energy companies have been described as an “insult” to millions of people struggling amid the cost of living crisis, with high oil and gas prices funding multibillion-pound rewards for their shareholders.  A day after households were warned average annual energy bills could hit £3,850 from January, triple the level at the beginning of this year, Shell and Centrica sparked outrage by announcing huge windfalls.  Shell posted record earnings of $11.4bn (nearly £10bn) for the three-month period from April to June and promised to give shareholders payouts worth £6.5bn.  Asked about the stark contrast with punishingly high bills faced by households already struggling amid sky-high inflation, Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said the company could not “perform miracles” to bring oil and gas prices down, adding: “It is what it is.”  At the same time, Centrica, the owner of British Gas, reinstated its dividend, handing investors £59m, after reporting operating profits of £1.3bn during the first half of 2022.  Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: “These eye-watering profits are an insult to the millions of working people struggling to get by because of soaring energy bills.  “Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history. It’s time working people got their fair share of the wealth they create, starting with real action to bring bills down.”  Debt advice charities, businesses and MPs redoubled their calls on ministers to take action now to avoid plunging millions more housholds into financial distress, as concern mounted at the lack of a coherent government plan.  The energy regulator, Ofgem, is due to announce a hike in the energy price cap within days. It will take effect from October, with another increase expected in January. According to forecasts issued earlier this week, unless the flow of Russian gas into Europe increases, average dual-fuel tariffs could soar to £3,850 a year from January.  If the prediction proves correct, average bills will have risen more than £2,500 within a year.  The war in Ukraine, combined with bottlenecks caused by pandemic lockdowns, has led to a surge in oil and gas prices, causing misery for motorists and households as the prices charged for gas, electricity and petrol have reached all-time highs.  Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, accused the government of being “asleep at the wheel”, amid a Tory leadership contest that is pitting the former chancellor Rishi Sunak against the foreign secretary, Liz Truss.  “As profits soar to record levels for oil and gas producers, we face a serious and worsening energy bills crisis, far worse even than a couple of months ago,” Miliband said.  He said both Truss and Sunak were “living on another planet” when it came to the “cost of living emergency”. In May, the government announced a £400 rebate on bills, which comes into effect in October and will be paid over six months.  But gas prices have since risen further, after Russia dramatically reduced the volume of gas it sends to Europe through its largest pipeline earlier this month.  The £400 rebate was only “scratching the surface”, according to experts at the energy analysis firm Cornwall Insight, which has warned that bills of more than £3,500 – or £300 a month – will last “well into 2024”. The debt charity the Money Advice Trust said the sum was “unlikely to provide much respite”.  Eight million vulnerable households are also entitled to separate support from a £15bn cost-of-living package, worth up to £1,200 each.  Labour has yet to come up with a comprehensive policy to tackle exorbitant bills. It has called on the government to scrap the 5% VAT rate on household energy, but this would only deliver further savings of £98 a year based on the current price cap, which is set at £1,971.  During the Tory leadership campaign, Sunak has also come out in favour of pausing these VAT charges, something he opposed when he had the power to implement it as chancellor.  Truss, who has said she would impose a moratorium on green levies added to bills, said on Thursday that she opposed windfall taxes on energy firms.  Miliband said Truss “appears to believe that the cost of living crisis can be solved by abandoning renewable energy – the cheapest form of power we have. The government is asleep at the wheel.”  Speaking after he unveiled Shell’s record quarterly profits, Van Beurden said oil companies were aware of the difficulties that ordinary people faced. “But we cannot perform miracles either,” he said. “I’m very mindful that that is a difficult message to hear, but it is what it is.”  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  More than 8m households – one in three in the UK – will fall into fuel poverty after October’s price cap rise, according to National Energy Action. Fuel poverty is defined as spending more than 10% of household income on energy.  The Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke told PoliticsHome on Thursday he had seen “absolute fear” in the eyes of his constituents and was “not sure” how his own family would pay their bills.  On Thursday, the UK’s three leading debt charities – Citizens Advice, the Money Advice Trust and StepChange – called on Ofgem to improve protections for consumers who owe money to their energy supplier, including cracking down on “harmful” debt collection practices.  Joanna Elson, the head of the Money Advice Trust, which runs National Debtline and Business Debtline, said: “Further targeted support is needed for the many people already unable to afford their energy bills and for those on the lowest incomes, including significantly raising benefits.”  An Ofgem spokesperson said: “Protecting consumers during these very difficult times is our top priority and we are doing all we can to hold suppliers to account on supporting their customers.  “Recently we reviewed all suppliers to make sure they were charging direct debits fairly, have told them to review the highest increases and asked some to make immediate improvements in how they handle them.”  Earlier this week, MPs on the business and energy select committee called for the energy price cap, introduced in 2019 in an effort to combat profiteering, to be replaced by a “social tariff”. This would involve the poorest households receiving discounted energy, with the cost funded either through taxation or spread between more well-off bill payers.  The MPs said millions of people would be plunged into unmanageable debt without further government help.  The Treasury said its windfall tax on energy profits, announced by Sunak earlier this year, would raise about £5bn in its first year to “help pay for support for millions of the most vulnerable households”.  A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We understand that global inflationary pressures are squeezing household finances, which is why the government has introduced an extraordinary £37bn package to help households, including £1200 each for 8m of the most vulnerable households.”","centrica,gas,profits,advice,shell,cause,prices,bills,households,energy,millions,soar,business,oil,insult,outrage",2022-07-28

10,Shell and Centrica post profits totalling £11bn as households struggle with bills,Jasper Jolly,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/shell-posts-10bn-quarterly-profits-as-households-struggle-with-bills,"Shell made record profits of nearly £10bn between April and June and promised to give shareholders payouts worth £6.5bn as the oil supermajor benefited from the surge in energy prices prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  The FTSE 100 company made adjusted profits of $11.5bn (£9.5bn) during the second quarter of the year, beating its previous high – set between January and March – by 26%. The profits were more than double the same period in 2021, and higher than expected by analysts.  It has been a period of roaring trade for Shell and other major oil and gas companies, in contrast to struggling households and much of the rest of the economy. Higher energy prices have caused inflation to soar to 40-year highs in the UK and elsewhere, and which threaten to tip economies into recessions across much of the world.  British Gas owner Centrica, also a member of the FTSE 100, on Thursday reinstated its dividend as it reported bumper operating profits of £1.3bn during the first half of 2022 thanks to higher prices for the oil and gas it drills.  Chris O’Shea, Centrica’s chief executive, said it was “the most challenging energy crisis in living memory” even as his company reported its highest adjusted operating profits since 2013.  The scale of the oil companies’ profits prompted the UK government to eventually give in to demands for a windfall tax to redistribute some of the profits, although some senior Conservative ministers are thought to favour removing the tax, amid a leadership campaign that will lead to a new prime minister and cabinet in September.  The windfall tax – known as the energy profits levy – did not come into force until 14 July, meaning the companies’ second-quarter profits and payouts to shareholders were not affected.  The sector has remained a bonanza for oil companies and their shareholders. Shell investors received $7.4bn in the first quarter of 2022 and will receive another $6bn in a share buyback and $1.8bn in dividends announced on Tuesday.  Shell said it had experienced “higher realised prices, higher refining margins and higher gas and power trading”.  Vladimir Putin’s invasionmeans Shell may have to abandon its stake in the Sakhalin-2 gas project with Russia’s Gazprom as well as petrol stations in the country. Yet the recognised costs of abandoning Russia are $4.3bn – just over a third of the profits Shell has made in three months after Kremlin troops entered Ukraine. The company had already booked costs worth $4.2bn related to its withdrawal from Russia, but it increased this estimate by only $111m in the second quarter of the year.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  Shell said it expected the tight energy market was here to stay. It added $4.3bn to its income attributable to shareholders to account for higher than expected prices in the mid- and long-term “reflecting the current energy market demand and supply fundamentals”.  Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, recognised the “huge challenges for consumers, governments and companies alike” caused by the “volatile energy markets”, but argued that the company was “using our financial strength to invest in secure energy supplies which the world needs today, taking real, bold steps to cut carbon emissions and transforming our company for a low-carbon energy future.”  Centrica’s dividend payment will be worth about £59m to shareholders. It made £900m during the quarter from its oil and gas drilling arm, which it is in the process of selling off part of.  Centrica’s retail business, under the British Gas brand, has also had to deal with extra costs because of an influx of customers from smaller energy suppliers who failed to prepare for higher prices.  It gained 158,000 new accounts when it took over the responsibility to sell gas and electricity to Together Energy’s customers.","centrica,gas,higher,companies,profits,shell,post,prices,struggle,households,bills,energy,totalling,company,oil,shareholders,11bn",2022-07-28

The London-headquartered energy company has shortlisted four internal candidates to take his place after months of succession planning efforts that were accelerated once Sir Andrew Mackenzie became Shell’s chair in May 2021.  Van Beurden, who took over in 2014, would leave Shell in the middle of the most severe energy crisis of his tenure, which has subsequently pushed the oil and gas giant’s profits to record highs.  The energy boss, who was paid €7.4m (£6.1m) in 2021, warned earlier this week that gas shortages in Europe would probably last several years, raising the prospect of continued energy rationing.  Van Beurden could be replaced by the Canadian head of Shell’s integrated gas and renewables division, Wael Sawan, who is said to be the frontrunner in Shell’s search for a successor, according to Reuters. Other candidates include Shell’s chief financial officer, Sinead Gorman, its head of upstream, Zoe Yujnovich, and the boss of the company’s downstream refining operations, Huibert Vigeveno, the newswire reported.  Shell declined to comment on Van Beurden’s pending departure or his potential successors.  His departure would end a near-40-year career at Shell, which he joined in 1983. During his time as chief executive he oversaw one of the company’s biggest acquisitions in decades, buying BG Group for $53bn in 2016, and recently orchestrated the relocation of the company’s headquarters from the Netherlands to London.  While he has steered the company through two major oil market downturns, Van Beurden will leave just as sky-high oil prices are pushing Shell’s profits to record levels. Those profits are subject to a windfall tax in the UK, where consumers are facing soaring costs.  Earlier this week, Van Beurden warned that looming gas shortages caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could persist for several years, raising fears of energy rationing. “It may well be that we will have a number of winters where we have to somehow find solutions,” he told a press conference in Norway on Monday.  Van Beurden said solutions to the energy crisis would have to found through “efficiency savings, through rationing and a very, very quick buildout of alternatives”.

14,South African court bans offshore oil and gas exploration by Shell,,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/01/south-african-court-bans-offshore-oil-and-gas-exploration-by-shell,"A South African court has upheld a ban imposed on the energy giant Shell from using seismic waves to explore for oil and gas off the Indian Ocean coast.  The judgment delivered in Makhanda on Thursday marks a monumental victory for environmentalists concerned about the impact the exploration would have on whales and other marine life.  The 2014 decision granting the right for the “exploration of oil and gas in the Transkei and Algoa exploration areas is reviewed and set aside”, the high court ruled in the southern city.  Civil rights organisations and civilians celebrated outside the courthouse following the verdict, according to local media.  A Shell spokesperson said the company “respect[s] the court’s decision” and would review the judgment to “determine our next steps”. Shell did not say if it would appeal against the judgment or not. “We remain committed to South Africa and our role in the just energy transition,” he said.  Last December the same court had issued an interim order prohibiting the firm from going ahead with its plans.  Green Connection, one of the environmental and human rights organisations that filed the case against Shell, said that “civil society, traditional communities and small-scale [fishermen] have once again been vindicated by the courts”.  The petroleum firm was set to collect 3D seismic data over more than 6,000 sq km (2,300 sq miles) of ocean off South Africa’s Wild Coast - a 300km (185-mile) stretch of rich waters housing exquisite marine life and natural reserves.  Campaigners argued the research would have sent “extremely” loud shock waves every 10 seconds, 24 hours a day for five months, potentially harming marine species and disrupting their routines.  South Africa’s energy ministry had backed the scheme, and criticised those who opposed it as thwarting investment in the country’s development.","waves,gas,sq,judgment,shell,court,bans,south,marine,energy,exploration,offshore,set,oil,african",2022-09-01
15,"European gas shortages likely to last several winters, says Shell chief",Gwyn Topham,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/29/european-gas-shortages-likely-to-last-several-winters-shell-chief-rationing-europe-russia,"Gas shortages across Europe are likely to last for several winters to come, the chief executive of Shell has said, raising the prospect of continued energy rationing as governments across the continent push to develop alternative supplies.  Cuts to the supply of Russian gas since the invasion of Ukraine have plunged European countries into a devastating energy crisis, driving up wholesale prices to leave consumers facing huge bills and the highest rates of inflation since the 1980s.  Speaking at a press conference in Norway on Monday, Ben van Beurden said the situation could persist for several years. “It may well be that we will have a number of winters where we have to somehow find solutions,” he said.  Van Beurden said solutions to the energy crisis would have to found through “efficiency savings, through rationing and a very, very quick buildout of alternatives”.  “That this is going to be somehow easy, or over, I think is a fantasy that we should put aside,” he added.  His comments come as Europe’s biggest economies brace for a tough winter of soaring inflation and the threat of recession, as record increases in gas and electricity bills pile pressure on households and businesses across the continent.  Russia, the major supplier of gas to most of the EU before the war in Ukraine, has throttled exports in response to western sanctions imposed since Vladimir Putin’s invasion six months ago. While not all EU countries are directly reliant on Russian supplies, competition for scarce resources has pushed wholesale European gas prices up by a factor of 12 compared with a year ago.  Britain sources little of its gas directly from Russia, although is exposed to soaring prices on the wholesale market. Liz Truss, who is likely to be the next British prime minister, has so far refused to spell out what help she would give to households as the price cap on energy bills jumps 80% to £3,549 a year from October.  Speaking on Monday, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said a package of emergency measures would be unveiled soon. Speaking in Slovenia as EU officials work on a plan, which could be announced as early as this week, Von der Leyen said “emergency interventions” would be introduced in addition to longer-term energy market reforms.  “Skyrocketing electricity prices are now exposing, for different reasons, the limitations of our current electricity market design,” she said.  The French prime minister, Elizabeth Borne, warned companies that energy could be rationed this winter, while Belgium’s energy minister said the next five to 10 years could be difficult.  Speaking alongside the Shell chief executive in Norway, the head of another energy company, TotalEnergies’s Patrick Pouyanné, said Europe’s governments and policymakers would have to plan for a future without Russian gas.  The comments were made at a ceremony to mark a carbon capture and storage deal between the two firms, the Financial Times reported. “If you think without it [Russian gas], we will manage. There is enough energy in this planet to do without it,” Pouyanné added.

European gas prices have soared in recent weeks, reaching almost €350 (£299) a megawatt hour last week as countries rushed to build up supplies before the winter. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Monday accused Russia of “economic terror” by trying to cut gas supplies to Europe.  “It is exerting pressure with price crisis, with poverty, to weaken Europe,” he said.  Maintenance work is expected to take place this week by Russian state-owned company Gazprom on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline that links Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea, complicating efforts to fill up gas storage sites.  Wholesale gas prices fell back on Monday after Germany’s economy minister said he expected the country’s storage to be 85% full next month. However, prices still remain more than triple the level at the start of this year.  Soaring energy prices have helped oil and gas companies to record bumper profits, prompting demands for windfall taxes to help finance emergency support for struggling households and businesses. Shell made record profits of nearly £10bn between April and June and promised to give shareholders dividends worth £6.5bn.","wholesale,winters,gas,supplies,winter,chief,storage,shell,prices,minister,russian,european,energy,week,likely,shortages",2022-08-29
16,"Shell to pay £536,000 for overcharging prepayment customers",Kalyeena Makortoff,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/25/shell-pay-536000-overcharging-prepayment-meter-customers,"Shell has agreed to pay half a million pounds for overcharging thousands of prepayment meter customers on default tariffs over the past three years.  The energy giant’s consumer arm, Shell Energy Retail, will refund and compensate 11,275 customers after it discovered that it had sent the wrong rates to users’ meters.  It meant that those customers were forced to pay more than allowed under the regulator’s price cap at various times since January 2019.  Prepayment meter users already pay for their energy at a higher rate and include some of the country’s poorest and most vulnerable households. Shell has agreed to automatically refund overcharged customers the £106,000 they are owed in total, pay £400,000 into Ofgem’s consumer redress fund, and make a further £30,970 in extra “goodwill payments” to affected customers.  The energy provider will pay a total of £536,970. Customers are expected to receive refunds worth £9.40 each, on average.  A Shell Energy spokesperson said: “We’re sincerely sorry that errors updating our prepayment meter rates resulted in some customers being overcharged for a period of time. As soon as we identified the issue we began taking steps to put it right, and self-reported it to Ofgem.” The company said it would be writing to customers to notify them about the payments.  Ofgem said the compensation package “would have been considerably higher” had Shell not self-reported the issue and taken steps to address the problem. The regulator also considered the additional financial hardship that the issue may have placed on prepayment customers, especially when energy prices have risen to historic highs.  The regulator’s director of retail, Neil Lawrence, said: “Ofgem expects suppliers to adhere to the terms of contracts they have with customers, particularly ensuring they pay no more than the level of the price cap.  “Households across Britain are already struggling with rising energy bills and living costs,” he added. “Overcharging by suppliers can cause additional and unnecessary stress and worry at what is already a very challenging time for consumers across the UK.”  Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is the second time the company has breached the price cap since it was introduced, having been forced in 2019 to compensate 12,000 customers whom it overcharged when the company was still trading under the First Utility brand. Shell bought the company in 2018.  “Ofgem is always prepared to work with suppliers who have failed to comply with their obligations, but who have self-reported and are determined to put things right, as Shell has done here,” Lawrence added. “The contributions Shell has made to the redress fund will help to support vulnerable consumers with their energy bills.”","overcharging,privacy,536000,customers,shell,prepayment,energy,suppliers,pay,company,price,selfreported",2022-08-25
17,"Church of England pension boss’s shares in Shell ‘shocking’, say campaigners",Damian Carrington,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/17/church-of-england-pension-bosss-shares-shell-clive-mather,"The chair of the Church of England Pensions Board, which has not divested its £3.5bn fund from fossil fuels, is a shareholder in Shell, the Guardian can reveal.  Clive Mather had a 38-year career at the oil company during which he oversaw a multibillion-dollar tar sands project in Canada.  The Church of England (C of E) has rejected pressure to sell off its fossil fuel holdings. Campaigners said these were unethical investments that were fuelling the climate crisis and urged Mather to resign.  In Britain, the Baptist church and United Reformed church have divested from fossil fuels. Around the world, 17 Anglican dioceses are among more than 500 churches and faith-based organisations that have divested.  The leader of the C of E, the archbishop Justin Welby, said at a recent global conference of Anglican bishops: “It’s the call of the church to stand alongside our brothers and sisters around the Anglican communion, who are already affected by climate change, and to safeguard the environment upon which all of us depend.”  Protesters at the conference calling for fossil fuel divestment included the Rev Vanessa Elston, from Southwark diocese and a member of the protest group Christian Climate Action. She told the Guardian the revelation that Mather owned shares in Shell was “shocking”.  “The C of E needs to divest because the fossil fuel companies have been lying and greenwashing for 40 years,” she said. “They have acted wickedly. If they were serious about the climate crisis, they would be putting 50% of their profits into renewables, but they are not doing anywhere near that.”  One of the Lambeth Calls, declarations published after the conference, demanded the “halting of new gas and oil exploration”. Shell’s short-term expansion plans amount to about 4bn barrels of oil. Elston said: “If you really are going to fulfil that call, that means divesting.”  Operation Noah, a Christian climate group, urged Mather to resign. “In light of his conflict of interest, Operation Noah calls for Mr Mather to consider his position,” said the Rev Dr Darrell Hannah, at All Saints church in Ascot and chair of trustees for the group. “And we again call on the C of E to divest from all fossil fuels immediately, not next year.”  The C of E £10bn church commissioners fund has also not divested from fossil fuels.  Bishop Shourabh Pholia, from the diocese of Barisal in Bangladesh and who attended the conference, said: “Up to 18 million people may have to migrate [from Bangladesh] because of sea-level rise,” he said. “Therefore, I want to stand with the protesters to do justice to the earth and save the whole of creation.”  Mather has always recused himself from any discussion of, or direct contact with, Shell. A C of E spokesperson said: “Any suggestion that Mr Mather’s shares in Shell in any way influences the pensions board’s investment policy around fossil fuels would be false. The pensions board and church commissioners have a clear five-year strategy on fossil fuels, agreed by the General Synod in 2018.”  He said the results included a net zero oil and gas standard being piloted by oil and gas majors, investor pressure leading to companies adopting emissions targets and divestment from companies refusing to engage. The C of E would divest from fossil fuel companies not aligned with the Paris climate agreement by July 2023, he said.

At the C of E’s general synod in July 2021, Mather described his former employer Shell as a “beacon across the sector”. Another member of the pensions board, Richard Hubbard, worked for BP for 28 years, while Welby was the group treasurer for Enterprise Oil from 1984 to 87.  Divestment campaigners argue that selling off fossil fuel shares is a powerful way to reduce companies’ social licence to operate and restrict their access to capital. More than 1,500 institutions managing $40tn have divested from fossil fuels, including almost 200 pension funds.  Shell said in 2020: “An erosion of our business reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand, our ability to secure new resources or access capital markets, and on our licence to operate.”  Opponents of divestment argue engaging with companies as shareholders to drive change is a better way to tackle the climate crisis. The C of E pension fund holds about £10m of fossil fuel shares.  The C of E pension board says it required fossil fuel companies it invests in to have “alignment of capital expenditure and production plans with a net zero target”. However, in February, the most comprehensive study to date concluded that accusations of greenwashing were well-founded against major oil companies that claim to be in transition to clean energy, including Shell.  “It’s clear that investor engagement has failed,” said Hannah. “Given the overwhelming harm that fossil fuel emissions are causing to people and planet, it is no longer ethical to profit from fossil fuels, something the C of E continues to do, and something that, sadly, Mr Mather is apparently still doing as well.”  One of the most high-profile supporters of fossil fuel divestment campaigns was the late Desmond Tutu, an Anglican archbishop. “People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice of climate change,” he told the Guardian in 2014.  The vast majority of fossil fuel reserves owned by countries and companies must remain in the ground if the climate crisis is to be ended, a 2021 analysis found.  Experts have warned that if governments fulfil their pledges to slash carbon emissions, much of these reserves could become worthless. A recent study found people in rich countries could lose more than $1tn in total.","companies,pension,shocking,say,campaigners,climate,c,shell,fuel,fuels,england,fossil,shares,bosss,mather,oil,church",2022-08-17
18,Shell to give staff 8% bonus after record profits,Julia Kollewe,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/shell-staff-bonus-record-profits-oil-gas-prices,"Shell is handing nearly all its 82,000 staff a bonus equivalent to 8% of their salary after the oil company reported record profits amid soaring energy prices.  The British multinational is making the one-off payment to the vast majority of its employees around the world, only excluding those on its executive committee, executive vice-presidents and contractors.  The oil firm said: “In recognition of the contribution our people have made to Shell’s strong operational performance against a recent challenging backdrop, our executive committee has decided to make a special recognition award of 8% of salary to all eligible staff across the world.  “The award enables those employees to share in our current operational and financial success – it is not a response to inflation or cost of living challenges.”  Last Thursday, the FTSE 100 company revealed it had made record profits of nearly $11.5bn (£9.5bn) for the second quarter in a row on the back of soaring oil and gas prices, and strong refining profit margins, and promised to give shareholders payouts worth £6.5bn.  It is a significant turnaround for a company that laid off thousands of workers, suspended bonuses and capped salaries during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, described the profits as “an insult to the millions of working people struggling to get by because of soaring energy bills”.  Overall, the world’s five biggest oil companies shared bumper profits of nearly $100bn in the first six months of this year.  On Tuesday, Shell’s UK rival BP was accused of “unfettered profiteering” after its underlying profits tripled to $8.5bn (£6.9bn) between April and June, thanks to high oil prices. It was its biggest quarterly profit in 14 years and BP said it would hand out nearly £4bn to shareholders as a result.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  This prompted calls for a tougher windfall tax on energy companies, which are enjoying a profits bonanza while consumers struggle with a cost of living crisis as energy and food prices surge. Households’ average annual energy bills are expected to exceed £3,600 this winter.  As Russia’s invasion grinds on, the research firm Cornwall Insight predicted the energy price cap on annual bills in Great Britain was on track to rise to £3,615 a year from January.  The cap, which is set quarterly by the energy industry regulator, Ofgem, was at £1,400 a year in October. Cornwall predicts the cap will remain above £3,400 for the entirety of 2023, piling further pressure on household finances.  Energy prices have soared amid fears over supplies caused in part by the war in Ukraine. The oil cartel Opec and its allies agreed a small increase in oil output by just 100,000 barrels a day on Wednesday, dashing hopes of a larger increase, which is likely to keep oil prices elevated.  The BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, whose total pay reached £4.5m last year, in February described BP as a “cash machine”, even before the war raised prices further.","soaring,staff,profits,executive,shell,prices,bp,energy,record,nearly,company,cap,oil,bonus",2022-08-03

21,Oil company profits boom as Americans reel from high fuel prices,Dominic Rushe,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/29/oil-gas-company-profits-fuel-prices-shell-exxon-chevron,"The US’s biggest oil companies pumped out record profits over the last few months as Americans struggled to pay for gasoline, food and other basic necessities.  On Friday, ExxonMobil reported an unprecedented $17.85bn (£14.77bn) profit for the second quarter, nearly four times as much as the same period a year ago, and Chevron made a record $11.62bn (£9.61bn). The sky-high profits were announced one day after the UK’s Shell shattered its own profit record.  Soaring energy prices have rattled consumers and become a political flashpoint. “We’re going to make sure everybody knows Exxon’s profits,” Joe Biden said in June. “Exxon made more money than God this year.”  The record profits came after similarly outsized gains in the first quarter when the largest oil companies made close to $100bn in profits.  High energy prices are one of the leading factors driving inflation to a four-decade high in the US. Gas prices have fallen slightly in recent weeks but are now averaging $4.25 a gallon across the US, more than $1 a gallon higher than a year ago.  Consumers are facing high fuel prices not just at the pump. Soaring energy prices are being baked into delivery costs, which is driving up the cost of everything from apples to toilet paper.  One reason gasoline prices have been so high is that fewer refineries are operating in the US than before the pandemic, so there is a limit to how much gasoline can be produced.  Biden has called for the companies to increase production and refining capacities in an attempt to bring down prices. On Friday Exxon said it was expanding refinery and production in Texas and New Mexico.  Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, increased its oil and gas production as crude prices hovered above $100 a barrel. Revenue at Exxon soared to $115.68bn, up from $67.74bn during the same quarter last year.  Natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices are also elevated due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and ensuing sanctions against Russia, a large supplier of natural gas. Many European nations have been scrambling for alternatives to Russian natural gas, and have been competing for boatloads of LNG, driving up prices for natural gas globally and in the US.  In addition to oil company executives, shareholders also reaped the benefits of high energy prices during the quarter. Since the start of 2022, Exxon and Chevron shares have risen close to 46% and 26%, respectively.  Exxon’s CEO, Darren Woods, attributed the company’s success to its investments in oil and gas fields in Guyana and the Permian Basin, as well as its investments in liquefied natural gas, which has been in high demand globally.  “We’re also helping meet increased demand by expanding our refining capacity by about 250,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2023 – representing the industry’s largest single capacity addition in the US since 2012,” Woods said in a prepared statement.  Chevron’s chief executive officer, Mike Wirth, sought to tamp down criticism that the company was profiteering at the expense of consumers.  “We more than doubled investment compared to last year to grow both traditional and new energy business lines,” Wirth said in the statement. “Chevron is increasing energy supplies to help meet the challenges facing global markets,” he said.  Exxon and Chevron’s bumper profits were announced a day after Shell posted record earnings of $11.4bn (nearly £10bn) for the three-month period from April to June.  Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of Britain’s Trades Union Congress, called the “eye-watering profits” “an insult to the millions of working people struggling to get by because of soaring energy bills.  “Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history. It’s time working people got their fair share of the wealth they create, starting with real action to bring bills down,” said O’Grady.

23,"With such eye-watering profits, Shell should invest more in low-carbon transition",Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jul/28/with-such-eye-watering-profits-shell-should-invest-more-in-low-carbon-transition,"BP’s Bernard Looney put it more succinctly last year when he described the company as “a cash machine at these types of prices”, but Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, was coming from the same place as he reflected on almost £10bn of profits in a single quarter. “Of course these are very significant [profit] margins, but these margins are not our doing. They are the doing of how global markets play out,” he said.  He’s right about market conditions obviously. A barrel of Brent fetched well over $100 during the quarter, gas prices have gone to the moon; refining capacity is severely tight; and the entire industry underinvested during the first year of the pandemic, creating near-perfect conditions for a spike in prices when Russia invaded Ukraine.  But the maddening bit of Van Beurden’s breezy account is what he says in the next breath – the claim to be “working very hard to bring on new supplies” and to be investing furiously in “the energy system of the future”, meaning a lower carbon one. Shell, it is obvious, could afford to allocate far greater sums to investment, including renewables, but is choosing not to do so.  Current plans involve numbers that look large at first sight: $23bn to $27bn of capital expenditure this year, with a one-third skew towards renewables; and, for a UK audience, an average of £3bn-a-year to be invested here until the end of the decade. The point, though, is that those spending plans flow from a model that was drawn up 18 months ago before a windfall fell into Shell’s lap.  The “financial framework” imagines that every last dollar, beyond what’s ear-marked for investment, debt-servicing and regular dividends, goes to shareholders via share buy-backs. The size of these buy-backs is now extraordinary: $6bn for the current quarter, after $8.5bn in the first half. Add regular dividends, and Shell, a company worth £150bn, could return 15% of its market capitalisation to investors in 2022.  Shareholders and pension funds must have prizes, of course, but allocating no extra capital towards low-carbon projects is indefensible given the resources suddenly at Shell’s disposal. The company calls its approach “disciplined”, but it is behaving as if nothing has changed, or that it has run out of ideas. The story here is not simply one of markets “playing out”. It is also about the pace at which the company funds transition. Shell could transition faster – much faster.  Reading the room  By contrast, it is impossible to get angry about Centrica’s modest dividend for shareholders, even if it attracts more political flak. The owner of British Gas hasn’t paid a dividend for two years and a half-year distribution of £59m, or a penny a share, does not come at the expense of useful investment.  The most important looming investment decision relates to the re-opening of the Rough offshore storage facility in the North Sea, which, everybody now agrees, should never have been closed. For the sake of energy security (gas and, in future, hydrogen), it is vital the company and the UK government find a contract-for-difference arrangement.  The contribution of British Gas, the retail supply business, to half-year operating profits of £1.3bn wasn’t much – £98m, equivalent to a profit margin of 2%. Instead, the money was mostly made in North Sea production and via higher prices for nuclear-generated electricity (Centrica owns a 20% stake in the UK’s fleet). Since those assets are captured by the windfall tax, outrage about the dividends should fade.  Distribution to shareholders are allowed, after all – indeed are vital to keep investment flowing. It’s the level, and the other aspects of a company’s performance, that matter. Shell looks grasping. Centrica, now that it’s stopped grumbling about the windfall tax and is talking about decarbonising projects, looks better attuned to the mood outside.  Never-boring Barclays  Many chief executives in the recent past have tried to make Barclays boring. CS Venkatakrishnan, who was supposed to mark a break from the era of regulatory thrills and spills under Jes Staley (and others before him), isn’t there yet.  The lowlight of the half-year numbers was a £581m net charge for a cock-up that saw the bank sell more structured notes – securities giving exposure to baskets of stocks, interest rates and so on – than it was authorised to flog.  The “litigation and conduct” fun continued via a $200m whack from US regulators’ clamp-down on traders sending work messages via WhatsApp, and a penalty for past larks with timeshare loans. The actual operational performance was fine, but you can see why the shares continue to be lowly rated. You never know what’s coming next with Barclays.","gas,halfyear,profits,shell,eyewatering,prices,investment,transition,quarter,shareholders,invest,company,shells,windfall,lowcarbon",2022-07-28
24,‘Insult to millions’: Shell and Centrica profits cause outrage as energy bills soar,Rob Davies,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/an-insult-soaring-profits-at-shell-and-centrica-cause-outrage,"Soaring profits at two of the UK’s biggest energy companies have been described as an “insult” to millions of people struggling amid the cost of living crisis, with high oil and gas prices funding multibillion-pound rewards for their shareholders.  A day after households were warned average annual energy bills could hit £3,850 from January, triple the level at the beginning of this year, Shell and Centrica sparked outrage by announcing huge windfalls.  Shell posted record earnings of $11.4bn (nearly £10bn) for the three-month period from April to June and promised to give shareholders payouts worth £6.5bn.  Asked about the stark contrast with punishingly high bills faced by households already struggling amid sky-high inflation, Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said the company could not “perform miracles” to bring oil and gas prices down, adding: “It is what it is.”  At the same time, Centrica, the owner of British Gas, reinstated its dividend, handing investors £59m, after reporting operating profits of £1.3bn during the first half of 2022.  Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: “These eye-watering profits are an insult to the millions of working people struggling to get by because of soaring energy bills.  “Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history. It’s time working people got their fair share of the wealth they create, starting with real action to bring bills down.”  Debt advice charities, businesses and MPs redoubled their calls on ministers to take action now to avoid plunging millions more housholds into financial distress, as concern mounted at the lack of a coherent government plan.  The energy regulator, Ofgem, is due to announce a hike in the energy price cap within days. It will take effect from October, with another increase expected in January. According to forecasts issued earlier this week, unless the flow of Russian gas into Europe increases, average dual-fuel tariffs could soar to £3,850 a year from January.  If the prediction proves correct, average bills will have risen more than £2,500 within a year.  The war in Ukraine, combined with bottlenecks caused by pandemic lockdowns, has led to a surge in oil and gas prices, causing misery for motorists and households as the prices charged for gas, electricity and petrol have reached all-time highs.  Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, accused the government of being “asleep at the wheel”, amid a Tory leadership contest that is pitting the former chancellor Rishi Sunak against the foreign secretary, Liz Truss.  “As profits soar to record levels for oil and gas producers, we face a serious and worsening energy bills crisis, far worse even than a couple of months ago,” Miliband said.  He said both Truss and Sunak were “living on another planet” when it came to the “cost of living emergency”. In May, the government announced a £400 rebate on bills, which comes into effect in October and will be paid over six months.  But gas prices have since risen further, after Russia dramatically reduced the volume of gas it sends to Europe through its largest pipeline earlier this month.  The £400 rebate was only “scratching the surface”, according to experts at the energy analysis firm Cornwall Insight, which has warned that bills of more than £3,500 – or £300 a month – will last “well into 2024”. The debt charity the Money Advice Trust said the sum was “unlikely to provide much respite”.  Eight million vulnerable households are also entitled to separate support from a £15bn cost-of-living package, worth up to £1,200 each.  Labour has yet to come up with a comprehensive policy to tackle exorbitant bills. It has called on the government to scrap the 5% VAT rate on household energy, but this would only deliver further savings of £98 a year based on the current price cap, which is set at £1,971.  During the Tory leadership campaign, Sunak has also come out in favour of pausing these VAT charges, something he opposed when he had the power to implement it as chancellor.  Truss, who has said she would impose a moratorium on green levies added to bills, said on Thursday that she opposed windfall taxes on energy firms.  Miliband said Truss “appears to believe that the cost of living crisis can be solved by abandoning renewable energy – the cheapest form of power we have. The government is asleep at the wheel.”  Speaking after he unveiled Shell’s record quarterly profits, Van Beurden said oil companies were aware of the difficulties that ordinary people faced. “But we cannot perform miracles either,” he said. “I’m very mindful that that is a difficult message to hear, but it is what it is.”  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  More than 8m households – one in three in the UK – will fall into fuel poverty after October’s price cap rise, according to National Energy Action. Fuel poverty is defined as spending more than 10% of household income on energy.  The Conservative MP Alec Shelbrooke told PoliticsHome on Thursday he had seen “absolute fear” in the eyes of his constituents and was “not sure” how his own family would pay their bills.  On Thursday, the UK’s three leading debt charities – Citizens Advice, the Money Advice Trust and StepChange – called on Ofgem to improve protections for consumers who owe money to their energy supplier, including cracking down on “harmful” debt collection practices.  Joanna Elson, the head of the Money Advice Trust, which runs National Debtline and Business Debtline, said: “Further targeted support is needed for the many people already unable to afford their energy bills and for those on the lowest incomes, including significantly raising benefits.”  An Ofgem spokesperson said: “Protecting consumers during these very difficult times is our top priority and we are doing all we can to hold suppliers to account on supporting their customers.  “Recently we reviewed all suppliers to make sure they were charging direct debits fairly, have told them to review the highest increases and asked some to make immediate improvements in how they handle them.”  Earlier this week, MPs on the business and energy select committee called for the energy price cap, introduced in 2019 in an effort to combat profiteering, to be replaced by a “social tariff”. This would involve the poorest households receiving discounted energy, with the cost funded either through taxation or spread between more well-off bill payers.  The MPs said millions of people would be plunged into unmanageable debt without further government help.  The Treasury said its windfall tax on energy profits, announced by Sunak earlier this year, would raise about £5bn in its first year to “help pay for support for millions of the most vulnerable households”.  A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We understand that global inflationary pressures are squeezing household finances, which is why the government has introduced an extraordinary £37bn package to help households, including £1200 each for 8m of the most vulnerable households.”","centrica,gas,profits,advice,shell,cause,prices,bills,households,energy,millions,soar,business,oil,insult,outrage",2022-07-28

26,Shell and Centrica post profits totalling £11bn as households struggle with bills,Jasper Jolly,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/shell-posts-10bn-quarterly-profits-as-households-struggle-with-bills,"Shell made record profits of nearly £10bn between April and June and promised to give shareholders payouts worth £6.5bn as the oil supermajor benefited from the surge in energy prices prompted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  The FTSE 100 company made adjusted profits of $11.5bn (£9.5bn) during the second quarter of the year, beating its previous high – set between January and March – by 26%. The profits were more than double the same period in 2021, and higher than expected by analysts.  It has been a period of roaring trade for Shell and other major oil and gas companies, in contrast to struggling households and much of the rest of the economy. Higher energy prices have caused inflation to soar to 40-year highs in the UK and elsewhere, and which threaten to tip economies into recessions across much of the world.  British Gas owner Centrica, also a member of the FTSE 100, on Thursday reinstated its dividend as it reported bumper operating profits of £1.3bn during the first half of 2022 thanks to higher prices for the oil and gas it drills.  Chris O’Shea, Centrica’s chief executive, said it was “the most challenging energy crisis in living memory” even as his company reported its highest adjusted operating profits since 2013.  The scale of the oil companies’ profits prompted the UK government to eventually give in to demands for a windfall tax to redistribute some of the profits, although some senior Conservative ministers are thought to favour removing the tax, amid a leadership campaign that will lead to a new prime minister and cabinet in September.  The windfall tax – known as the energy profits levy – did not come into force until 14 July, meaning the companies’ second-quarter profits and payouts to shareholders were not affected.  The sector has remained a bonanza for oil companies and their shareholders. Shell investors received $7.4bn in the first quarter of 2022 and will receive another $6bn in a share buyback and $1.8bn in dividends announced on Tuesday.  Shell said it had experienced “higher realised prices, higher refining margins and higher gas and power trading”.  Vladimir Putin’s invasionmeans Shell may have to abandon its stake in the Sakhalin-2 gas project with Russia’s Gazprom as well as petrol stations in the country. Yet the recognised costs of abandoning Russia are $4.3bn – just over a third of the profits Shell has made in three months after Kremlin troops entered Ukraine. The company had already booked costs worth $4.2bn related to its withdrawal from Russia, but it increased this estimate by only $111m in the second quarter of the year.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  Shell said it expected the tight energy market was here to stay. It added $4.3bn to its income attributable to shareholders to account for higher than expected prices in the mid- and long-term “reflecting the current energy market demand and supply fundamentals”.  Ben van Beurden, Shell’s chief executive, recognised the “huge challenges for consumers, governments and companies alike” caused by the “volatile energy markets”, but argued that the company was “using our financial strength to invest in secure energy supplies which the world needs today, taking real, bold steps to cut carbon emissions and transforming our company for a low-carbon energy future.”  Centrica’s dividend payment will be worth about £59m to shareholders. It made £900m during the quarter from its oil and gas drilling arm, which it is in the process of selling off part of.  Centrica’s retail business, under the British Gas brand, has also had to deal with extra costs because of an influx of customers from smaller energy suppliers who failed to prepare for higher prices.  It gained 158,000 new accounts when it took over the responsibility to sell gas and electricity to Together Energy’s customers.","centrica,gas,higher,companies,profits,shell,post,prices,struggle,households,bills,energy,totalling,company,oil,shareholders,11bn",2022-07-28
