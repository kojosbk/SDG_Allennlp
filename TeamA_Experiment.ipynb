      "New York (CNN Business)Netflix is synonymous with streaming, but its competitors have a distinct advantage that threatens the streaming leader's position at the top. Disney has Disney+, but it also has theme parks, plush Baby Yoda dolls, blockbuster Marvel movies and ESPN. It's worked out well for the company - so far. Or put another way, the company's lackluster user growth last quarter is a signal that it wouldn't hurt if Netflix - a company that's lived and died with its subscriber numbers - started thinking about other ways to make money. Not so fast\n",
      "There are ways for Netflix to make money other than raising prices or adding subscribers. Netflix could have 30-second commercials on their programming or get sponsors for their biggest series and films. His reasoning: It doesn't make business sense. You know, advertising looks easy until you get in it. Then you realize you have to rip that revenue away from other places because the total ad market isn't growing, and in fact right now it's shrinking. So if Netflix is looking for other forms of near-term revenue to help support its hefty content budget ($17 billion in 2021 alone) then what can it do? Netflix could crack down on password sharing - a move that the company has been considering lately. That's going to help them get to a higher level of penetration, definitely, but not in long-term.\" Lackluster growth is still growth\n",
      "Missing projections is never good, but it's hardly the end of the world for Netflix. The company remains the market leader and most competitors are still far from taking the company on. We used to do that thing shipping DVDs, and luckily we didn't get stuck with that. We define entertainment as the main thing,\" Hastings said. He added that he doesn't think Netflix will have a second act in the way Amazon has had with Amazon shopping and Amazon Web Services. Rather, Netflix will continue to improve and grow on what it already does best. \"I'll bet we end with one hopefully gigantic, hopefully defensible profit pool, and continue to improve the service for our members,\" he said. \" I wouldn't look for any large secondary pool of profits. There will be a bunch of supporting pools, like consumer products, that can be both profitable and can support the title brands.\n"
