2, 3. What authority has Jesus been given?," Jesus is overseeing the preaching work. How can we be sure of that? Shortly before he ascended to heaven, Jesus met with a number of his faithful followers on a mountain in Galilee. He told them: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth.” Note his very next statement: “Go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations.” (Matt. 28:18, 19) So, among other things, Jesus has been given the authority to direct the preaching work.",117,"Jesus is overseeing the preaching work, among other things. he told his followers: ""all authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth"" he also told them: ""go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations"". he has been given the authority to direct the preaching work, among other things. he is also directing the teachings of the church in the uk - a church in syria, israel and iran.","Jesus met with a number of his faithful followers on a mountain in Galilee. he said: ""go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations"" he then said: ""go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations"" he then said: ""go, therefore, and make disciples of people of all the nations"""
3, 4. Why can we be sure that Jesus is still supervising the preaching work?, Jesus stated that the preaching and disciple-making work would be accomplished in “all the nations” and that he would be with his followers “all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.” (Matt. 28:20) Those statements clearly indicate that the preaching work would continue under Jesus’ supervision right down to our day.,74,Jesus stated that the preaching and disciple-making work would be accomplished in “all the nations” and that he would be with his followers “all the days until the conclusion of the system of things” (Matt. 28:20) Those statements clearly indicate that the preaching work would continue under Jesus’ supervision right down to our day.

4, 5. What part are we having in the fulfillment of Psalm 110:3?," Jesus was not worried that there would be a shortage of workers during the conclusion of the system of things. He knew that the prophetic words of the psalmist would be fulfilled: “Your people will offer themselves willingly on the day of your military force.” (Ps. 110:3) If you are sharing in the preaching work, you are supporting Jesus and the faithful slave and are helping to fulfill that prophecy. The work is going ahead, but there are challenges.",105,"the work is going ahead, but there are challenges. if you are sharing in the preaching work, you are supporting Jesus and the faithful slave. if you are sharing in the preaching work, you are helping to fulfill that prophecy. the work is going ahead, but there are challenges. if you are sharing in the preaching work, you are supporting Jesus and the faithful slave, he says.","bob greene: Jesus was not worried about shortage of workers. he says you are supporting Jesus and the faithful slave. greene: if you are sharing in the preaching work, you are helping to fulfill that prophecy. greene: if you are sharing in the preaching work, you are supporting Jesus and the faithful slave. he says if you are sharing in the preaching work, you are supporting Jesus and the faithful slave."
5, 6. What is one challenge that Kingdom preachers face today?," One challenge that Kingdom preachers face is opposition. Apostates, religious leaders, and politicians have given many the wrong impression about our work. If our relatives, acquaintances, and workmates are misled by this propaganda, they may pressure us to stop serving Jehovah and to stop preaching. In some countries, the opposition takes the form of intimidation, threats, arrests, and even imprisonment. We are not surprised at this reaction. Jesus foretold: “You will be hated by all the nations on account of my name.” (Matt. 24:9) The very fact that we are experiencing such hatred is proof that we have Jehovah’s approval. (Matt. 5:11, 12) The Devil is behind this opposition. But he is no match for Jesus! With Jesus’ support, the good news is reaching people of all nations. Consider the evidence.",192,"apostates, religious leaders, and politicians have given many the wrong impression about our work. if relatives, acquaintances, and workmates are misled by this propaganda, they may pressure us to stop preaching. with Jesus’ support, the good news is reaching people of all nations. consider the evidence. apostasy, christianity, and apostasy are just a few of the challenges that kingdom preachers face - apostasy, christi","apostates, religious leaders, and politicians have given many the wrong impression about our work. the very fact that we are experiencing such hatred is proof that we have Jehovah’s approval. the very fact that we are experiencing such hatred is proof that we have Jehovah’s approval. apostates, religious leaders, and politicians have given many the wrong impression about our work."
6," 7. What evidence do you see that Revelation 14:6, 7 is being fulfilled?"," As Kingdom preachers, we also face the challenge of overcoming a language barrier. In the revelation that he gave to the apostle John, Jesus disclosed that in our day the good news would overcome that obstacle. (Read Revelation 14:6, 7.) How so? We are giving as many people as possible a chance to respond to the Kingdom message. Today, people around the world can read Bible-based material on our jw.org website because it contains information in over 1,000 languages! Approval was given to translate the Enjoy Life Forever! book​—our main study tool for making disciples—​into more than 700 languages! Spiritual food has also been made available by means of video recordings for the deaf and publications in braille for the blind. We are seeing Bible prophecies being fulfilled.

7, 8. What have been the results of our preaching activity thus far?," Today, well over 8,000,000 people in 240 lands are associating with Jehovah’s organization, and each year tens 
of thousands get baptized! More important than numbers, however, are the spiritual qualities, “the new personality,” that these new disciples have cultivated. (Col. 3:8-10) Many stopped being immoral, violent, prejudiced, and nationalistic. The prophecy recorded at Isaiah 2:4 is being fulfilled; they are ‘not learning war anymore.’ As we work hard to put on the new personality, we help draw people to God’s organization and we prove that we are following our overseer Christ Jesus. (John 13:35; 1 Pet. 2:12) None of this happens by accident. Jesus is giving us the help we need.",173,"more important than numbers, however, are the spiritual qualities, ""the new personality,"" that these new disciples have cultivated. as we work hard to put on the new personality, we help draw people to God’s organization and prove that we are following our overseer Christ Jesus.

8," 9. According to Matthew 24:45-47, what was foretold concerning the time of the end?"," Read Matthew 24:45-47. Jesus foretold that during the time of the end, he would appoint a “faithful and discreet slave” to provide spiritual food. So we would expect that slave to be hard at work in our day. This has proved to be the case. Our overseer has used a small group of anointed men to provide God’s people and interested ones with spiritual “food at the proper time.” These men do not view themselves as masters over the faith of others. (2 Cor. 1:24) Instead, they recognize that Jesus Christ is the “leader and commander” of his people.​—Isa. 55:4.",147,a small group of anointed men provide spiritual “food at the proper time”.

9,10. Which of the publications shown in the artwork convinced you to walk on the path to everlasting life?," Since 1919 the faithful slave has prepared a variety of publications that have given newly interested ones their first taste of nourishing spiritual food. In 1921 the slave prepared the book The 
Harp of God to help interested ones to learn basic Bible teachings. As times changed, additional publications were provided. Which publication helped you to come to know and love our heavenly Father?

10,11. Why is it vital that all of us receive spiritual food?," Newly interested people are not the only ones who need solid spiritual food. All of us do. The apostle Paul wrote: “Solid food belongs to mature people.” Paul added that applying such spiritual sustenance would help us “to distinguish both right and wrong.” (Heb. 5:14) In these difficult times when morals are at an all-time low, it can be a real challenge to adhere to Jehovah’s standards. But Jesus sees to it that we obtain the strength we need through appetizing spiritual food. The source of this food is God’s inspired Word, the Bible. The faithful slave prepares and distributes this food under Jesus’ direction.",147,"the source of this food is God’s inspired Word, the Bible. the faithful slave prepares and distributes this food under Jesus’ direction. the faithful slave prepares and distributes this food under Jesus’ direction. the source of this food is God’s inspired Word, the Bible. the faithful slave prepares and distributes this food under Jesus’ direction. a christian church is a christian church whose mission is to feed the poor. christianity is a","the source of this spiritual sustenance is God’s inspired Word, the Bible. the source of this food is God’s inspired Word, the sacrament of the christ. the source of this food is God’s inspired word, the sacrament of the sacrament of the sacrament of the sacrament of the sacrament of the sacrament of the sacrament of the sacrament of the "
11,"12. Like Jesus, how have we regarded God’s name?"," Like Jesus, we have given God’s name the prominence that it deserves. (John 17:6, 26) For example, in 1931 we adopted the Scriptural name Jehovah’s Witnesses, thus attaching ourselves in a very personal way to our heavenly Father. (Isa. 43:10-12) And since October of that year, the divine 
name has appeared on the front cover of each issue of this magazine. In addition, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures has restored God’s name to its rightful place in his Word. What a contrast to the churches of Christendom that have removed Jehovah’s name from many of their Bible translations!",152,"we have given God’s name the prominence that it deserves. in 1931 we adopted the Scriptural name Jehovah’s Witnesses. in addition, the new world translation of the Holy Scriptures has restored God’s name to its rightful place in his Word. what a contrast to the churches of Christendom that have removed Jehovah’s name from many of their Bible translations.","in 1931 we adopted the Scriptural name Jehovah’s Witnesses, thus attaching ourselves in a very personal way to our heavenly Father. since October of that year, the divine name has appeared on the front cover of each issue of this magazine.

12,13. What convinces you that Jesus is using “the faithful and discreet slave” today? (John 6:68)," By means of “the faithful and discreet slave,” Jesus has built up a remarkable organization on earth to promote pure worship. How do you feel about that organization? In response, perhaps you think of the words of the apostle Peter, who said to Jesus: “Whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life.” (John 6:68) Where would any of us be today if we had not come in contact with Jehovah’s organization? Through it, Christ makes sure that we are well-fed spiritually. He also trains us to carry out our ministry effectively. Further, he helps us to put on “the new personality,” so that we are pleasing to Jehovah.​—Eph. 4:24.",162,"jehovah's organization promotes pure worship. through it, Christ makes sure that we are well-fed spiritually. he also trains us to carry out our ministry effectively. he helps us to put on ""the new personality,"" so that we are pleasing to jehovah. if you are a Christian, you are a member of the church.","bob greene: Jesus has built up a remarkable organization on earth to promote pure worship. greene: through it, Christ makes sure that we are well-fed spiritually. greene: if you are a believer, you will be able to see that you are not a slave. greene: if you are a believer, you will be able to see that you are not a slave. greene: if you are a believer, you will be able"
13,14. How have you benefited from being part of Jehovah’s organization during the COVID-19 pandemic?," Jesus provides wise direction in times of crisis. The benefits of that direction were evident when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. While many in the world were uncertain about what course to take, Jesus made sure that we received clear guidance to keep us safe. We were encouraged to wear 
face coverings when out in public and to practice physical distancing. The elders were reminded to maintain regular contact with all in the congregation and to be aware of their physical and spiritual needs.

But time and time again, it became evident that the direction we received was well-founded.
